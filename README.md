# Project Melborune

**What is this project for?**

- The main assumption of the project is to deepen knowledge about creating projects in Unity 3d.
- The next step is to get closer to using artificial intelligence in practice and using it to create creative and satisfying content for the end user.
- Another goal is to develop and improve skills in every possible way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Latest verison of Unity that can be downloaded from [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). This sample game was tested using Unity 2022.2.16.
- The game was tested on Windows PC, but one should be able to port it to other platforms too.
